## 6. Testing Phases and Findings
**Results and findings from various testing phases**

### 6.1 Unauthenticated Tests
**Findings from testing the target without any authentication**

| Title | Description | Steps to Reproduce | PoC | Impact | Remediation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unauthorized Access to User Data via Weak API Endpoint | An unauthenticated user can access any user's data by manipulating the API endpoint parameters. | 1. Open the browser and navigate to <https://example.com/api/users?id=123>. 2. Observe that the API returns user data without requiring authentication. | `curl -X GET "https://example.com/api/users?id=123"` | Compromised user data could lead to account takeovers, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential financial losses for users. | Implement proper authentication and authorization checks for API endpoints. Consider using API keys or OAuth for better security. | Acknowledged |

### 6.2 Authenticated Tests
**Findings from testing the target with valid user credentials**

| Title | Description | Steps to Reproduce | PoC | Impact | Remediation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Insecure Direct Object References (ID| Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) - User Profile Update | A logged-in user can update another user's profile by manipulating the request parameters. | 1. Log in as a regular user (user@example.com). 2. Navigate to the user profile page (e.g., <https://example.com/profile/123>). 3. Open the browser developer tools and modify the request parameters to update another user's profile (e.g., change the 'name' parameter to 'New Name'). 4. Submit the request and observe that the other user's profile is updated. | `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "name=New%20Name" "https://example.com/api/users/456"` | An attacker could update other users' profiles, change their passwords, or perform other unauthorized actions, leading to account compromise and data loss. | Implement proper authorization checks to ensure that users can only update their own profiles. | Acknowledged |

### 6.3 Business Logic Tests
**Findings from testing the application's business logic and workflows**

| Title | Description | Steps to Reproduce | PoC | Impact | Remediation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bypass Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) | A user can bypass the minimum order quantity requirement by manipulating the request parameters. | 1. Add a product with a MOQ of 10 to the cart. 2. Open the browser developer tools and modify the request parameters to change the quantity to 5. 3. Proceed to checkout and observe that the order is placed successfully. | `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "quantity=5" "https://example.com/api/cart/update"` | An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to purchase products in smaller quantities than intended, leading to stock mismanagement and potential financial losses for the vendor. | Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent users from bypassing the MOQ requirement. | Acknowledged |

### 6.4 Other Tests
**Results and findings from other tests, such as rate limiting, session management, or third-party integrations**

| Title | Description | Steps to Reproduce | PoC | Impact | Remediation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rate Limiting Bypass - Account Creation | An attacker can bypass the account creation rate limiting mechanism by using multiple IP addresses or rotating proxies. | 1. Create a script to automate account creation requests. 2. Use a rotating proxy service to change IP addresses between requests. 3. Observe that the rate limiting mechanism is bypassed, allowing an attacker to create multiple accounts in a short period. | N/A (script-based attack) | An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create multiple accounts, leading to inflated user numbers, spam, or other malicious activities. | Implement a more robust rate limiting mechanism that considers user behavior, device fingerprints, and other factors to prevent IP address-based bypasses. | In Progress |

- **2024-08-03:** Noticed that the application uses a custom-built authentication system. Further investigation is required to understand its security implications.
- **2024-08-05:** Observed that the application relies heavily on third-party services for functionality. It is essential to assess the security of these integrations as well.
- **2024-08-07:** Noticed that the application does not implement proper rate limiting for API endpoints. This could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) conditions if exploited.

## 10. Next Steps and Future Testing
**Planned next steps and future testing activities**

- **Next Steps:**
  - Investigate the custom-built authentication system further to identify potential vulnerabilities.
  - Assess the security of third-party integrations and services used by the application.
  - Evaluate the application's performance and stability under increased load to identify potential DoS conditions.
- **Future Testing:**
  - Conduct regular re-testing to ensure that the application remains secure after updates and patches.
  - Explore potential mobile and IoT integrations for the application, if applicable.
  - Consider performing physical security testing, such as social engineering or hardware-based attacks, if authorized.
